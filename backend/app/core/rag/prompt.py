"""
Prompt construction for the Qwen/Ollama clause classifier.

Improvements vs original:
- Stronger candidate constraint language for small/medium models.
- Explicit ordered decision rules that favor evidence over keyword matching.
- Clear abstention path (NO_APPLICABLE_LABEL) instead of forced labels.
- Keeps retrieved examples framed as evidence, not automatic answers.

Task:
Identify the MAIN LEGAL FUNCTION of the clause and select exactly one label from the Allowed candidate list below.

Strict decision rules (follow in order):
1. Read the original clause carefully. Prefer the primary contractual function when several concepts appear.
2. Use retrieved training examples only as evidence. Do NOT automatically copy the top-1 label.
3. Compare the clause against the label definitions of the Allowed candidates.
4. Distinguish rights, obligations, restrictions, permissions, conditions, limitations, termination mechanisms, and financial commitments.
5. Do not rely on keyword matching alone.
6. Do not invent facts that are not supported by the clause text.
7. If the clause is metadata, boilerplate, or the evidence is weak / conflicting, return NO_APPLICABLE_LABEL.
8. UNKNOWN, OTHER, NONE, UNCLASSIFIED, NO_MATCH, and NO_LABEL are forbidden. Use NO_APPLICABLE_LABEL for safe abstention.

Output requirements:
- Return ONLY a single JSON object.
- Schema: {{"clause_type": "<one Allowed candidate or NO_APPLICABLE_LABEL>"}}
- No markdown, no explanation, no extra keys.

Original clause:
\"{clause_text}\"

Allowed candidate CUAD categories:
